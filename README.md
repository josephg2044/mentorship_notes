These are the notes I have taken as part of my mentorship project under [Professor Jim Freericks](https://physics.georgetown.edu/jim-freericks/#)
Research project is WIP.

This project involves developing closed-form sixth-order perturbation expressions using Messiah's Kato-based resolvent and contour-integral formalism. This is used to benchmark Wigner-Brillouin and cumulant expansions on the displaced harmonic oscillator.
